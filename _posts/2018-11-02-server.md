### Server ip

-------

1. 首先登录跳板机172.16.101.136

2. lidd然后从跳板机访问172.16.0.248

### Port forward：

-----------

１．ssh -N -f -L 2222:172.16.0.248:22 lidd@172.16.101.136

２．ssh lidd@localhost -p 2222

### To connect network

------

1. ``sudo vim /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base``
2. add 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' to file
3. ``resolvconf -u``

### ssh key setting

-----

​	You run the first command once to set up your public/private key pair and then you run the second command once for each host you want to connect to.

```bash
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id hostname
```

or you can do it manually by append your local pub key to your server's 1.  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

for detais, refer [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html)

### sshfs mount

------

##### mount

`sshfs lidd@localhost:/home/lidd /home/dd/remote -p 2222`

##### unmount

`fusermount -u /home/dd/remote` or `umount /home/dd/remote`

#### auto mount on start up

*note: this is very **dangerous**!!! if the network has some problem, then you can not turn on your computer since system cannot find remote disk*

add 

`sshfs#lidd@localhost:/home/lidd /home/dd/remote -p 2222 fuse defaults,auto,allow_other 0 0`

 to file '/etc/fstab'



### Transparent Multi-hop SSH

------

- your computer: dd
- your jump machine: jumper
- remote server: g-server

1. `subl ~/.ssh/config`

2. add following to it 

   > Host jumper
   > ​	user lidd
   > ​	HostName 172.16.101.136
   >
   > Host g-server
   > ​	user lidd
   >   	ProxyCommand ssh -q jumper nc -q0 172.16.0.248 22

   Then you can direct use 

   ```bash
   ssh g-server
   ssh -X g-server
   scp path/to/local/file g-server:path/to/remote/file
   ```

3. improve speed 

   * mkdir ~/.ssh/tmpmkdir ~/.ssh/tmp

   * add these two lines **at the start** of your `~/.ssh/config` (make sure to use your username in place of '*YOUR-NAME*'):

   > ControlMaster auto
   > ControlPath   /home/YOUR-NAME/.ssh/tmp/%h_%p_%r

### Jupyter notebook and tensorboard on remote

--------

> note: jupyter notebook only can be access by [localhost], so we must forward ssh tunnel twice

#### Method 1：

1. on jumper :

   add following to './ssh/config'

   ```
   Host jupyter_dd
   	HostName 172.16.0.248
   	LocalForward 10048 localhost:8889
   	User lidd
   Host tensorboard_dd 
   	HostName 172.16.0.248
   	LocalForward 10049 127.0.0.1:6006
   	User lidd
   ```

   and then run 

   ```
   ssh -f -N jupyter_dd
   ssh -f -N tensorboard_dd
   ```

   Here, I am not sure why tensorboard need '127.0.0.1' but not 'localhost'

2. on your computer add following to './ssh/config'

   ```
   Host jupyter
   	HostName 172.16.101.136
   	LocalForward 8889 localhost:10048
   	User lidd
   Host tensorboard
   	HostName 172.16.101.136
   	LocalForward 8008 localhost:10049
   	User lidd
   ```

   and then run 

   ```bash
   ssh -f -N jupyter
   ssh -f -N tensorboard
   ```

   ​	

#### Method ２：

1. on jumper :

   ```bash
   ssh -f -N -L 10048:localhost:8889 lidd@172.16.0.248
   ```

2. on your computer 

   ```bash
   ssh -f -N -L 8889:localhost:10048 lidd@172.16.101.136
   ```

   then run jupyter notebook and tensorboard on server by running

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 upyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889
   tensorboard --logdir=runs --host localhost 
   ```

   then you can visit jupyter by https://localhost:8889 and https://locahost:8008 , but you have to input token on jupyter

   > notice: if you use relative dirctionary, you must **run tensorboard in the dirctionary**, otherwise tensorboard con't find your log data to show

#### Visit jupyter notebook without token

1. on server run `jupyter notebook --generate-configjupyter notebook --generate-config`

2. open `ipython` and run

   ```
   In [1]: from notebook.auth import passwd
   In [2]: passwd()
   Enter password: 
   Verify password: 
   Out[2]: 'sha1:ce23d945972f:34769685a7ccd3d08c84a18c63968a41f1140274'In [1]: from 
   ```

   Here, the password is for you to log in jupyer notebook to replace the random token on browser

3. ```
   vi ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
   ```

   add following text to it

   ```
   c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' #the output of last step
   c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
   c.NotebookApp.port =8889 #指定一个端口
   ```

4. visit jupyter by https://localhost:8889 and input the password you setted before and enjoy it!
