## RL note

### classification

- model-based: previous observation **predict** following rewards and observations
- model-free: train it by intuition 
- police-based: **directly** approximating the policy of the agent
- value-based: the agent calculates the **value of every possible action**
- off police: the ability of the method to learn on old **historical data** (obtained
- on police: requires **fresh data** obtained from the environment





## Police-based method

**just like a classification problem**

- NN input: observation
- NN output: distribution of actions
- agent: random choose action base on distribution of actions(police)



#### cross-entropy method

1. Play N number of episodes using our current model and environment. 
2. Calculate the total reward for every episode and decide on a reward boundary. Usually, we use some percentile of all rewards, such as 50th or 70th.
3. Throw away all episodes with a reward below the boundary. 
4. Train on the remaining "elite" episodes using observations as the input and issued actions as the desired output.
5. Repeat from step 1 until we become satisfied with the result.

use **cross-entropy loss** function as loss fuction





























































### NN

#### sigmoid

*<u>It transfer a value input to (0,1)</u>*


$$
f(x)=\frac{L}{1+e^{-x}} = \frac{e^{x}}{e{x}+1}
$$

#### **softmax**

In short, *<u>It transfer K-dimensional vector input to (0,1)</u>*

In mathematics, the softmax function, or normalized exponential function, is a generalization of the logistic function that "squashes" a K-dimensional vector **z**  of arbitrary real values to a K-dimensional vector  \sigma(**z**) of real values, where each entry is in the range (0, 1), and all the entries add up to 1.

#### tanh

*<u>It transfer a value input to (-1,1)</u>*


$$
f(x)=tanh(x)= \frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}
$$

#### **relu**

$$
f(x)=max(0,x)
$$
